# MoonLander
MoonLander is a game I developed with two other UCSC students. The objective of the game is to guide a red spaceship through the game's five levels, avoiding the various enemies. 

The playable file is called "MoonLander".

The various scripts used in the game are under the "Scripts" tab. All scripts are written in C#.

Assets used to build the game are included in the "Assets" tab.
